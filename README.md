A repo to showcase a Form Recognizer sample. Since this [page](https://www.scribd.com/document/399594551/2015-06-22-MARK-S-VISION) did not allow for Zuckerberg's
2015 strategy memo to be easily copied and pasted, this offered an opportunity to use Form Recognizer to pull out
the text through OCR and render in text. For API details, refer this
